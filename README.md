**KODIJIVELETTE**

kodijive is intented to **watch on the kodi display (commonly a TV) the information about the streamed music from your multiroom SqueezeBox**.
it is, normally, compliant with the last version of Logitech  media server formely named SqueezeCenter, Squeezebox Server
or SlimServer
As it communicate with the server, it need a server (sender the music) and a player (receiver the music) to be
operationnal. In this alpha version, kodijivelette could not drive enterely your music library, just watching what it's 
playing and some more functions.
To drive completely the streamed music you can get Android app on smartphone like Squeezer... 
or use the web interface of the server. 
In future release, if you wish, it will be able to add more control on the music streamed.

**It doesn't include the player** (receiver the music) unlike other addons "Xqueeze" (author : bossanova) and
"plugin.audio.squeezebox" (author : marcelvedt) that include Squeezelite. On LibreElec you can install
other Addon (MultimediaTools) to get Squeezelite binary running as a player ; or you can use at home
other hardware receiver, or simple player based on raspberry pi with improved softwares all-in-one like
PicorePlayer, Max2Play, etcoetera , have a look to the appropriate documentation of these software. 
But if you are here is that you already know all this, is not it?

This is an alpha version and I have great hard work to increase its functionnality.

I gave the name kodijivelette addon which is not a very great originality being a kind of tiny jivelite
running on the platform kodi

I hope that this little kodi addon will please you
